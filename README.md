# Event-Driven-Stimulator
This program simulates network traffic within a dynamically generated network topology, handling packet flows, calculating latencies, tracking packet delivery, and visualizing network performance metrics. It leverages the NetworkX library for topology creation and manipulation, and Matplotlib for generating plots of network statistics.

**Features**
Dynamic topology generation with support for Barabasi-Albert and Waxman models.
Simulation of packet flow, including handling of packet arrivals and departures.
Calculation and tracking of packet latencies, delivery, and loss.
Visualization of packet transmission rate, latencies, and file sizes over time.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
NetworkX
Matplotlib
